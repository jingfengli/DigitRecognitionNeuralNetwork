# DigitRecognitionNeuralNetwork
The network is initally developed for a graduate school class project

This is a multilayer perceptron used for recognizing handwritten digits. 
Training is fulfilled using back-propagation algorithm. 
I used a popular dataset (‘mnist_all.dat’) comprising of training and testing samples of the different digits is provided in the Midterm folder. Each sample is 28x28 gray scale 8-bit image.
